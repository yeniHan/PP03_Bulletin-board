# PP03_Bulletin-board
<h4>This is a bulletin board.<br/>
I made this as a part of the group project, "Weventory"(https://github.com/wcodingforever/weventory).

<h3><i>The page is divided into 3 parts according to their roles.<br/><br/>
A. Bulletin board<br/>
B. Write article<br/>
C. Read article<br/></h3></i>
<br/><br/><br/>

<h2>Part A. Bulletin board</h2>

<h3>1. Sticky articles</h3>
Admins can write sicky articles which are arranged on the top of the bulletin board.<br/>
Sticky articles are distinguished with "Red".
<br/><br/>

<h3>2. Showing the number of reply articles</h3>
Next to the title, how many reply articles each article has is marked.
<br/><br/>

<h3>3. Hits</h3>
The 'hits' column shows how many times users have clicked the article.
<br/><br/>

<h3>4. Ask for help</h3>
The button leads to the page where users can send their articles. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


<h2>Part B. Wrtie article</h2>
<h3>1. Sticky mode</h3>
If the user is an admin member, an additional option, sticky mode'll be added.<br/><br/>

<h3>2. Password</h3>
If a user wants to make the article private, <br/>
By setting the password, the access to the article can be resticted.
<br/><br/>

<h3>3. Tags</h3>
<br/>
<div align="center">
    <img src="photos/write-article-tags.png" width="650px"/> 
</div>
<br/>

<h4>Conditions</h4>
- Max. 10 tags<br/>
- The same tag can't be added.<br/>
<br/>
If the conditions was not met, an alert message'll report about the error. 
<br/><br/>

<h3>4. File attatchment</h3>
<br/>
<div align="center">
    <img src="photos/write-article-file-attatchment.png" width="650px"/> 
</div>
<br/>

<h4>Conditions</h4>
- Max. 3 files<br/>
- The same file can't be added.<br/>
<br/>
If the conditions was not met, an alert message'll report about the error. 
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>


<h2>Part C. Read article</h2>
<h3>1. Private article</h3>
If a user enters the correct password for the article, the content of the article'll be shown. 
<br/><br/>
<h3>2. Reply articles</h3>
<br/>
<div align="center">
    <img src="photos/private-child-article.png" width="650px"/> 
</div><br/>
A article can have multiple reply articles. <br/>
<br/>
<h4>Private child article</h4>
If an user set a password for the reply article, a child article also can be a private article.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>

P.S. Since I made this as a practice, it has many incomplete parts. <br/>
For example, not using hash codes when sending passwords, inefficient ways to create HTML elements. <br/>
I am planning to improve these parts soon.
